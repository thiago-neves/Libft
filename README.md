# Libft
A Library with re-writed standard C functions.

## Getting started

To be able to use the library functions you'll have to compile the library using the `make` command, it'll generate a file called libft.a.

## Makefile commands

```make``` compile and generates the libft.a.

```make clean``` clean all the .o files from the folder.

```make fclean``` executes the `make clean` command and remove libft.a from the folder.

```make re``` executes the `make clean` and `make` commands to recompile the library.

```make n```executes the norminette.
